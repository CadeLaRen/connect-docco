# docconnect

Bringing literrate programing tool docco as connect/express middleware.

Nothing fancy, the idea is to generate dynamically upon request a docco generated page from files. 

##### why

cause I love docco and the Litterate programming should be Quick and Dirty.

Technical bloggers often writes about code, why not using docco as blogging tool. Because, litterate blogging should be Quick and Dirty too.
