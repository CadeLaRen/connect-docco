# connect-docco

Bringing the literate programing tool docco as a connect/express middleware.

Nothing fancy, the idea is to generate dynamically upon request a docco generated page from files.

#### why

cause I â™¥ docco and the "Literate Programming can be Quick and Dirty" thing.

Technical bloggers often write about code, why not using docco as a blogging tool. Because, literate blogging should be Quick and Dirty too.

or simply to get immediate results of docco against local files, which happen to be quite handy.
